You can make temporary copies on one of the workstations, but be aware of the space limitations.\nEnsure the raw data is backed up: that’s why we’re using SCC, they handle all the backups.\nRecord all the steps used to process data.\n\nSoftware\n\nCheck into git (and GitHub) anything that has been written by hand by a human (except data tables).\nWrite explanatory comments at the top of your scripts, with at least one example on how to use it.\nKeep changes small and commit often.\nBe ruthless about eliminating duplication.\nMake dependencies and requirements explicit (e.g. requirements.txt)\n\nManuscripts\n\nKeep a running manuscript as you’re working on the project: we use a mix of Overleaf and Word\nUse a reference manager to automatically handle the bibliography: we recommend Zotero and Mendeley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWilson, Greg, D.
